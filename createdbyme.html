		<p>My Design Philosophy: First Principle Design Thinking</p>
		<p>â€œA problem well-stated is half-solved"--Charles Kettering</p>
		<p>As a UX designer, I spend most of my time to understand the users and their needs. I keep asking myself "why?" again and again with multiple user research methods since I need to understand the fundamental principles and reasons behind those needs. Therefore, I can breakdown all the problems into these most basic truths, and use them to create new solutions outside the box. </p>
